## SI 206 2017
## Project 3
## Building on HW7, HW8 (and some previous material!)

##THIS STARTER CODE DOES NOT RUN!!


##OBJECTIVE:
## In this assignment you will be creating database and loading data 
## into database.  You will also be performing SQL queries on the data.
## You will be creating a database file: 206_APIsAndDBs.sqlite

import unittest
import itertools
import collections
import tweepy
import twitter_info # same deal as always...
import json
import sqlite3

##### TWEEPY SETUP CODE:
# Authentication information should be in a twitter_info file...
consumer_key = twitter_info.consumer_key
consumer_secret = twitter_info.consumer_secret
access_token = twitter_info.access_token
access_token_secret = twitter_info.access_token_secret
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)

# Set up library to grab stuff from twitter with your authentication, and 
# return it in a JSON format 
api = tweepy.API(auth, parser=tweepy.parsers.JSONParser())

##### END TWEEPY SETUP CODE

## Task 1 - Gathering data

## Define a function called get_user_tweets that gets at least 20 Tweets 
## from a specific Twitter user's timeline, and uses caching. The function 
## should return a Python object representing the data that was retrieved 
## from Twitter. (This may sound familiar...) We have provided a 
## CACHE_FNAME variable for you for the cache file name, but you must 
## write the rest of the code in this file.

CACHE_FNAME = "206_APIsAndDBs_cache.json"
# Put the rest of your caching setup here:



# Define your function get_user_tweets here:





# Write an invocation to the function for the "umich" user timeline and 
# save the result in a variable called umich_tweets:




## Task 2 - Creating database and loading data into database
## You should load into the Users table:
# The umich user, and all of the data about users that are mentioned 
# in the umich timeline. 
# NOTE: For example, if the user with the "TedXUM" screen name is 
# mentioned in the umich timeline, that Twitter user's info should be 
# in the Users table, etc.



## You should load into the Tweets table: 
# Info about all the tweets (at least 20) that you gather from the 
# umich timeline.
# NOTE: Be careful that you have the correct user ID reference in 
# the user_id column! See below hints.


## HINT: There's a Tweepy method to get user info, so when you have a 
## user id or screenname you can find alllll the info you want about 
## the user.

## HINT: The users mentioned in each tweet are included in the tweet 
## dictionary -- you don't need to do any manipulation of the Tweet 
## text to find out which they are! Do some nested data investigation 
## on a dictionary that represents 1 tweet to see it!


## Task 3 - Making queries, saving data, fetching data

# All of the following sub-tasks require writing SQL statements 
# and executing them using Python.

# Make a query to select all of the records in the Users database. 
# Save the list of tuples in a variable called users_info.

users_info = True

# Make a query to select all of the user screen names from the database. 
# Save a resulting list of strings (NOT tuples, the strings inside them!) 
# in the variable screen_names. HINT: a list comprehension will make 
# this easier to complete! 
screen_names = True


# Make a query to select all of the tweets (full rows of tweet information)
# that have been retweeted more than 10 times. Save the result 
# (a list of tuples, or an empty list) in a variable called retweets.
retweets = True


# Make a query to select all the descriptions (descriptions only) of 
# the users who have favorited more than 500 tweets. Access all those 
# strings, and save them in a variable called favorites, 
# which should ultimately be a list of strings.
favorites = True


# Make a query using an INNER JOIN to get a list of tuples with 2 
# elements in each tuple: the user screenname and the text of the 
# tweet. Save the resulting list of tuples in a variable called joined_data2.
joined_data = True

# Make a query using an INNER JOIN to get a list of tuples with 2 
# elements in each tuple: the user screenname and the text of the 
# tweet in descending order based on retweets. Save the resulting 
# list of tuples in a variable called joined_data2.

joined_data2 = True


### IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE TO CLOSE YOUR DATABASE CONNECTION AT THE END 
### OF THE FILE HERE SO YOU DO NOT LOCK YOUR DATABASE (it's fixable, 
### but it's a pain). ###
